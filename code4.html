  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <p>
    Hi! My name is Myrah, and I'm in 6th grade. I'm originally from the U.S., but now I live in Europe. I love nature, biking, fresh air, listening to music, walking my dog- a German Shorthaired Pointer called Rousseau- and of course, books. There's nothing I love more than curling up on my couch with a book.</p>
    <p>

   Before COVID, me and my friends loved having these discussions: "Oh wow, you must try that book! I loved reading it!" Sound familier? If it doesn't, that's okay. When COVID started, it became harder and harder to share books. When things got really bad, and book stores strarted closing down, it got harder jut to <i>buy</i> books.
   <p>

  I recently got interested in coding, so I decided to take <i>Girls Can Code</i>'s HTML and CSS classes online. When they said that they were going to help us make a website, I was like: <i>I wanna make a Book Nook!</i> And so I did.

      When I thought about what to write, my thoughts immediatley jumped to Rick Riordan's series. I love that series, because it's fantasy and mythology all in one. This series has helped me get though some tough times. It's definetly made me laugh. It's inspired me to write stories with my friend Phileine.

        Phileine is one of those friends who really gets you. She's that friend who likes you for being <i>you.</i> The one who corrects you gently, who laughs <i>with</i> you not <i>at</i> you. The one who puts you back on track. I'm sure you all have that kind of friend. if you don't, don't worry, a friend like that is coming to you in the near future.

        Phileine and I were classmates</p>
