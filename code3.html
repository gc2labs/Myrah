      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>
        Hi! In the times of today, you can barely step out of your house. When you do, you have to wear a mask everywhere, which isn't fun and makes you want to step out less. At home, you can't really do anything except look on your phone (if you have one), watch T.V (which is bad for your eyes and brain), or do your homework (which is just plain boring). Let's face it. Being a tween/teen in the middle of the 2019/2020/2021 pandemic is awful. But now, I have a new form of entertainement: Books. Yes, I know that for the Tiktokers out there reading this, books sound like something from the Middle Ages that your great-great-great-grandma used to read as a kid, when there was no Internet. But take my word for it, books are much more amazing and beautiful and... I could actually keep talking about books for 365 days and I would never get tired of it. On the Home Page, there are 2 of my <i>favorite</i> authors, both fiction and non-fiction. To get there, you can click the "Home Page" button on the top of the screen. There are pictures included, and even some trailers! So Tiktokers. Give the book a try.
