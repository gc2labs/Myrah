<h1>My Favorite Fiction Author: Rick Riordan</h1>
<h2>Books about Greek, Roman, Egyptian and Norse Mythology</h2>
<p>



His full name is Richard Russell Riordan Jr.
He writes a whole series about Mythology in modern day.</p>

<h1>Mythology</h1>

<h2>The Greek Series</h2>

<h3>What Is It About?</h3>
<p>

Percy Jackson, a boy the age of 12, who lives in Manhattan with his mom and his awful stepdad, finds out that his dad, whom he never met, is the Greek god Poseidon, god of the sea. He then goes to a camp for kids like him, who have a Greek god for a parent. The camp is called Camp Half-Blood. Soon after he arrives,a threat emerges. To stop it, Percy gos on a quest with Annabeth Chase, daughter of Athena- the goddess of wisdom and warfare and Percy's best friend, Grover Underwood, a satyr- a man with goat legs, feet and horns. Can Percy return to Camp Half-Blood- alive?</p>
<h3>Why Do I Like This Series?</h3>
<p>
I like this series because of Rick Riordan's style of writing. Percy doesn't talk like a grown-up, he talks like a 12 year old and I think it's more fun for kids my age to read. Mr. Riordan also excels at describing a scene. When I'm reading the series I can almost picture the Manhattan backdrop.</p>
<h3>Why Should You read This Series?</h3>
<p>


If you're an in-the-middle reader (too little for pictures, not big enough for 400 page books) like me, I think this series is perfect for you. Why? Because, since the book is written from the perspective of Percy, Rick Riordan writes about the Teenage Ups and Downs, Puberty, the Confusion of LOVE, and everything else you're probably going/went through at his age. I always read it when I was feeling sorry for myself  and I end up laughing and saying: "No matter how bad I have it, Percy has it WORSE!"</p>

<h2>The Greek and Roman series</h2>
<h3>What Is It About?</h3>
<p>

In this series, Rick Riordan introduces 3 new characters, one with amnesia. They arrive in a troubled time, when one of the main characters from the previous series, Percy Jackson, suddenly disappered. 6 months later, he appears in a different camp where everyone has a tattoo on their arm and speaks Latin. Percy feels completly lost at this Roman camp, but he has one goal in mind: to get back home. He goes on a quest to get some answers, about the Roman camp and why Hera, queen of all goddesses, took him away, erased his memory and brought him to the Roman camp. At the Greek camp, Jason, who belongs to the other camp, goes and does more or less the same thing. Both of them get shocking answers. Can the 2 camps forget the differencesand stop the threat to their respective homes?</p>
<p>


I really like this series because it's all about friendship, love and a new era. Also, it's from a lot of the characters perspective and to be writing from the perspective of someone you're not must've taken a lot of skill. And Rick Riordan makes the most unexpected plot twists. The series didn't end the way I expected it to.</p>
<h3>Why Should You Read This Book?</h3>
<p>

I think you should read this book because it's entertaining, it's a good way to pass the time, and for in-between readers like me, it's grown-up enough so you're not bored, but not too grown-up, otherwise you wouldn't understand anything.</p>

<h2>The Egyptian Series</h2>
<h3>What Is It About?</h3>
<p>

After their dad blows up the Rosetta Stone, the lives of Carter and Sadie Kane go from mildly interesting to very bizzare in a matter of seconds. They are forced to accept the truth: They are magicians. Egyptian Gods actually exist. And not all of them are good. Carter and Sadie race against time to save the world. Can they stop Apophis- the giant snake of Chaos- before he swollows the sun?
</p>
<h3>Why Do I Like This Series?</h3>
<p>

I like this series because Rick Riordan takes a comepletly different take on it. In the Greek and Roman series, gods were more or less helpful. In this series, magicians are trained to fight gods. They see them as powerful beings that must be held at bay, or Order will be engulphed in Chaos.
</p>
<h3>Why Should You Read This Series</h3>
<p>


If you have read the Greek series and the Greek and Roman series which I talked about earlier, you should definetly read this series. It's the same form of writing and it comepletly changes your opinion of gods. Also, if you're geting a headache from all the talk about: "Greek and Roman Gods are actually the same gods" then I strongly advise you to take from that, and start this series because this has absolutly nothing to do with Greek or Roman gods.</p>
<h3>The Kane Chronicles: The Red Pyramid</h3>

<h2>The Norse Series</h2>
<h3>What Is It About?</h3>
<p>
Magnus Chase has seen his share of trouble. Ever since that night two years ago when his mother told him to run, he has lived alone on the streets of Boston, using his wits to stay one step ahead of the police. One day, Magnus finds out that someone else is trying to find him. His Uncle Randolph, someone his mother always told him to stay away from. Magnus gets curious-he goes to investigate and falls right in to his uncle's clutches. Once Randolph finds him, he tells Magnus a shocking piece of information: his dad is the Norse god Frey. The more Randolph talks, the more puzzle pieces fall into place. Randolph's story explains why he never met his dad, why his mother loved the outdoors so much. Randolph shows him where his birthright lies, but before he can use it, a fire giant named Surt kills him. This should be the end of the story right? Well sometimes, the end is only the beginnig.</p>
<h3>Why Do I LIke This Series?</h3>
<p>
Rick Riordan really changed things up in this series. One, Magnus is homeless. Two, he dies in the first or second chapter. Three, he super duper sarcastic. So sarcastic it's funny. When you start reading, you can already tell that he is sarcastic, moody, and doesn't like to hang on to the past. In each series, Rick Riordan takes it on differently. The first two series were simple enough, that is if you get used to the Greek/Roman headache. The third series is cmepletly different. This series, is more or less the same as the Greek/Roman series, but with a major twist. Still, it's good to get away from one crazy headache and cleanse your palette.</p>
<h3>Why Should You Read This Series?</h3>
<p>
I think people who need a bit of a break from goody-goodies (like Carter Kane) and want more time with the sassy, sarcastic, and the mischevious (like Sadie Kane) should definetly read this book.It's from the perspective of Magnus, so it's so sarcastic it's funny! Even the chapters are sarcastic. Every time I read a chapter, I always BURST out laughing! So, if you love sarcasm please, read this book.</p>
